1. Setup the Font: We always use google font. If a font provided, is not a google font, this need to be reported to client. Once we have the font name we can configure the font in theme option (if there is a theme option)
  1.1 For headlines (h1 - h6) setup the font family and the font-size
  1.2 Setup the content font family and font-size
  1.3 If there is any special font (Like Script fonts etc) used anywhere in the website that needs to be assigned. If the theme has an      option to set that up do it there. if there isn't any option on the theme option, we can use 3rd party plugins for google font.
